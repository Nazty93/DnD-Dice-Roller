This is an extremely simple dice roller I made for my resume. I wanted to show off my knowledge of Python and some of the core concepts of programming. Some of the concepts showcased are GUI, Global Variables, Function Definition, Input Validation, 'For' Loops, and 'If' statements. 
I plan to update this code as I learn more about what can be done with Python.
Some updates I have planned include: Pictured background, adding an animation for each dice roll, adding natural 20 and natural 1 functionality (sound, message, animation).
